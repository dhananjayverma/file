function average(a, b) {
    return (a + b) / 2;
  }
  
  console.log(average(2, 1));

  
/*

The average function takes two parameters a and b.
In the corrected code, (a + b) is enclosed within parentheses to ensure that the addition operation is performed first.
The sum of a and b is divided by 2 to calculate the average.
The console.log statement calls the average function with the arguments 2 and 1.
The output of console.log(average(2, 1)) will be 1.5, which is the correct average of 2 and 1 (i.e., (2 + 1) / 2 = 1.5).
With the corrected code, the average function will return the expected result.
